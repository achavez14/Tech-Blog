# Tech-Blog

## Description
Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog platform where developers can publish articles, blog entries and interact with the community. The application adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm in its architectural structure using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM for database interaction and the express-session npm package for authentication.
